# ScenicRouting
C++ app where OSM points of interest are downloaded based on start-end coordinates and desired walking time and then a meta-heuristic algorithm will build the most efficient route between these POIs maximizing the total priority of the POIs and minimizing the walk time. 

Installations needed:
-libcurl for requesting OSM data
-nlohmann json for requests processing
